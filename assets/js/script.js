        question: "What is the first step in wound care?",
        answers: [
            { text: "Assess the patient & wound", correct: true, explanation: "Assessing the patient's wound is considered the first step in wound care because it helps determine the appropriate treatment course. A thorough assessment can help identify the type of wound, its severity, and any underlying conditions that may affect the healing process This information is critical in developing a treatment plan tailored to the specific needs of the patient. Additionally, wound assessment can help identify any potential complications that may arise during the healing process, such as infection or delayed healing." },

        question: "What is the best way to manage a wound with heavy exudate?",
        answers: [
            { text: "Use a hydrofiber dressing", correct: true, explanation: "Hydrofiber dressings are a type of absorptive dressing that contain sodium carboxymethylcellulose. They are highly absorbent and can absorb a large amount of wound exudate, transforming it into a soft gel that creates a moist wound environment. This gel helps to promote autolytic debridement, which is the process of removing dead tissue from a wound. Hydrofiber dressings are also able to maintain their integrity even when they are wet, which makes them ideal for managing heavy exudate." },

            { text: "Optimal nutrition", correct: true, explanation: "Nutrition is a critical factor in wound healing because it plays a vital role in the bodyâ€™s ability to repair and regenerate tissue. Proper nutrition is essential for optimal wound healing, as it provides the body with the necessary nutrients to support the healing process. A balanced diet that includes adequate amounts of protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals is essential for wound healing. Protein is particularly important, as it is necessary for the production of new tissue. Vitamins such as vitamin C and vitamin A are also important, as they play a role in collagen synthesis and immune function, respectively. Additionally, adequate hydration is essential for wound healing, as it helps to maintain the skin elasticity and promotes the flow of nutrients to the wound site." },

        question: "What is the best way to manage a wound with minimal exudate?",
        answers: [
            { text: "Use a hydrocolloid dressing", correct: true, explanation: "Hydrocolloid dressings are ideal for minimally exudating wounds because they are absorptive dressings that can help to maintain a moist wound environment. They are composed of a combination of gel-forming substances that in the presence of wound exudate, cross-react to form a gel. This gel helps to promote autolytic debridement, which is the process of removing dead tissue from a wound." },

            { text: "Use a hydrocolloid dressing", correct: false },
            { text: "Use a collagen dressing", correct: true, explanation: "In addition to promoting tissue regeneration, collagen dressings can also help to maintain a moist wound environment, which is essential for optimal wound healing. They can also help to absorb excess exudate and provide a protective barrier against bacteria and other contaminants." },
